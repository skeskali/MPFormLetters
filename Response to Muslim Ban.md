Dear Dr./Ms./Mrs./Mr, J. Doe (MLA/MPP or MP) OR
Dear Minister (if Cabinet Minister):

As a citizen living in your riding, I’m writing this letter to share my concern regarding the recent travel ban in the United States. This action has left many innocent immigrants and already traumatized refugees in legal limbo or worse, sent back to countries where they may be in real danger.

I realize Canada should not judge or dictate American immigration policy, but there are aspects of our refugee acceptance process that I think should be strengthened, particularly in light of recent events.

I am urging the Liberal government, and you personally, to quickly take action to reinstate the Temporary Public Policy to sponsor Syrian and Iraqi refugees by Groups of Five and Community Sponsor program, and if possible increase the number of refugees we let into Canada, after appropriate security checks.

I would also ask that you reexamine the Safe Third Countries Agreement. It is clear the United States may not be a safe harbour for refugees and landed U.S. immigrants from the seven countries named in President Trump’s recent executive order, or for countries as yet  unnamed in future executive orders.

I realize that international relations are never simple or straightforward, and that in this case there are further complications in dealing with our biggest trading partner and next door neighbour. But Canada has a proud tradition of bringing in the best of the rest of the world, who are often also its least fortunate. As Canadians we have a moral duty to continue and strengthen our course of action regardless of policies in this or future U.S. governments.

Sincerely,
[Your Name and Signature]
